[Processing.py](http://py.processing.org)) support for Atom.\n\n[Converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)\n\nfrom the Sublime Text [Processing.py](https://github.com/tildebyte/processing-py-sublime) package (which, iirc, was itself probably converted from the Sublime Text [Processing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Processing) package).\n\n### What is it?\n\nProvides:\n\n* Syntax Highlighting (this grammar is essentially an addon for Magic Python; it has **not** been tested with e.g. atom's default `language-python`).\n\n* Snippets\n\n* Advice on getting pylint to behave in a rational manner.\n\n* TODO: Build system.\n\n### Participating\n\nContributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.md) &copy; Ben Alkov\n\n",
