# Python mode for Processing (a.k.a. [Processing.py](http://py.processing.org)) support for Atom.
[Converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the Sublime Text [Processing.py](https://github.com/tildebyte/processing-py-sublime) package (which, iirc, was itself probably converted from the Sublime Text [Processing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Processing) package).

### What is it?
Provides:
* Syntax Highlighting (this grammar is essentially an addon for Magic Python; it has **not** been tested with e.g. atom's default `language-python`).
* Snippets
* Advice on getting pylint to behave in a rational manner.
* TODO: Build system.

### Participating
Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
